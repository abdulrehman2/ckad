You have a Deployment named web-deploy running the image nginx:1.25 with 3 replicas. Perform the following tasks:

1. Check the current rollout status
2. Update the image to nginx:1.26
3. Verify the rollout status
4. Check the rollout history
5. Simulate a bad rollout by setting image to nginx:badimage
6. Verify the rollout failure
7. Rollback to the previous working version
8. Confirm the rollback was successful
 
1️. Check current rollout status
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deploy
```

2️. Update image to a newer version
```bash
kubectl set image deployment/web-deploy web=nginx:1.26 --record
```

3️. Verify rollout status after update
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deploy
```
this will print something like

```bash
Waiting for deployment "nginx" rollout to finish: 1 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
```

4️. View rollout history
```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/web-deploy
```

this will print something like
```bash
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         kubectl set image deployment/nginx nginx=nginx:1.26 --record=true
```

5️. Simulate a bad rollout
```bash
kubectl set image deployment/web-deploy web=nginx:badimage --record
```

6. Watch rollout fail
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deploy
```

7️. Rollback to last working version
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-deploy
```
