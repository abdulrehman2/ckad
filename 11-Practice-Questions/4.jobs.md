✅ SECTION 1 — JOBS
## Q1. Create a Job that runs a container and exits successfully

Task:
Create a Job named hello-job that runs the image busybox and prints "Hello CKAD" and exits.

Answer:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox
        command: ["echo", "Hello CKAD"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

## Q2. Verify job success and logs

Task:
Check job status and view job pod logs.

Answer Commands:
```bash
kubectl get jobs
kubectl describe job hello-job
kubectl logs job/hello-job
```

## Q3. Run a Job multiple times

Task:
Create a Job named multi-runner that must succeed 3 times.

Answer:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: multi-runner
spec:
  completions: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: runner
        image: busybox
        command: ["echo", "Run"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```
## Q4. Run Pods in parallel

Task:
Create a Job named parallel-job that runs 5 pods in total, with 2 running at the same time.

Answer:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: parallel-job
spec:
  completions: 5
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pjob
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Parallel run"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

## Q5. Cleanup job pods automatically after completion

Task:
Modify a Job so its Pods are deleted 60 seconds after finishing.

Answer:
```yaml
spec:
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 60
```

## Q6. Job retry limit

Task:
Create a Job that only retries 2 times if it fails.

Answer:
```yaml
spec:
  backoffLimit: 2
```

✅ SECTION 2 — CRONJOBS
## Q7. Create a CronJob that runs every minute

Task:
Create hello-cron that runs every 1 minute, printing "Hi from Cron".

Answer:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello-cron
spec:
  schedule: "* * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hi
            image: busybox
            command: ["echo", "Hi from Cron"]
          restartPolicy: Never
```


## Q8. Check the last execution of the CronJob

Task & Commands:
```bash
kubectl get cronjobs
kubectl get jobs --watch
kubectl logs job/<latest-job-name>
```

## Q9. Prevent a CronJob from starting a new Job if previous is still running

Task:
Add field to allow only one job at a time.

Answer:
```yaml
spec:
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
```

(Options: Allow | Forbid | Replace)

## Q10. Suspend a CronJob (stop scheduling future jobs)

Answer:
```bash
kubectl patch cronjob hello-cron -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
```

## Q11. CronJob timezone note (important for CKAD)

Kubernetes CronJobs use the cluster’s timezone (usually UTC) — there is no timezone field in CronJob spec.

✅ SECTION 3 — TROUBLESHOOTING (COMMON CKAD CASES)
## Q12. A Job never finishes and keeps retrying — why?

Most common cause: restartPolicy is not Never or OnFailure.

Correct it using:
```yaml
restartPolicy: Never
```

## Q13. A CronJob is created, but no Jobs run — what do you check?

✅ Check schedule format
✅ Check .spec.suspend
✅ Check Controller Manager logs (rare in CKAD)

Commands:
```bash
kubectl describe cronjob <name>
```

✅ Rapid Commands Cheat Sheet (Exam Speed)
kubectl create job test --image=busybox -- echo hi
kubectl create cronjob cj --image=busybox --schedule="*/5 * * * *" -- echo hi
kubectl logs job/<jobname>
kubectl delete job --all
kubectl get cj,jobs,pods
